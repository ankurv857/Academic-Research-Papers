\section{Related Work}
In the last decade, various machine learning methods for predicting consumer purchase pattern have been analyzed in
the academia field and some of them are often used by practitioners. In most cases those approaches are based on extracting 
customerâ€™s latent characteristics from its past purchase behavior and applying ML formulation \cite{fader2009probability}. 
Previous studies have analyzed the use of random forest and Xgboost techniques in order to predict 
customer retention. Past consumer behavior was used as potential explanatory variable 
for modelling such patterns. In \cite{martinez2020machine}, the authors develop a model for predicting wether a 
customer performs a purchase in some prescribed future time frame based on purchase information from the past. 
They propose customer characteristics such as the number of transactions observed in past time frames, 
time of the last transaction, and the relative change in total spending of a customer. 
They found gradient boosting to perform best on the tested data. On Time Series part of the problem,
Close to our work is Deep Neural Network Ensembles for Time Series Classification \cite{fawaz2019deep}. 
In this paper, authors show how an ensemble of multiple deep learning models can significantly improve upon the 
state-of-the-art performance of individual neural networks.
We propose neural network architectures which outperforms the gradient boosting type of models.
