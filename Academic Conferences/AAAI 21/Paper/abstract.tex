Predicting future consumer behaviour is one of the most challenging problems for large scale retail firms. 
Accurate prediction of consumer purchase pattern enables better inventory planning and
efficient personalized marketing strategies. A good inventory planning helps minimise the instances of Out of stock 
and Excess Inventory as well as smart personalized marketing ensures smooth and delightful shopping experience.
Consumer purchase prediction problem has generally been addressed by ML researchers in conventional manner either 
through recommender systems or traditional ML approaches. To our knowledge traditional models have not generalized well 
enough in predicting the consumer purchase pattern. In this paper, we present our study of consumer purchase behaviour 
wherein we establish a data-driven framework to predict whether a consumer is going to purchase an item 
within a certain time frame using e-commerce retail data. To model this relationship, we create a sequential time-series data
for each of the relevant consumer-item combination. We then build generalised non-linear models by generating features
at the intersection of consumer, item and time. We demonstrate robust performance by experimenting with different neural 
network architectures, ML models and their combination. We showcase the benefits neural network architectures like Multi 
Layer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory and Temporal Convolutional Networks bring over ML models like Xgboost \cite{Xgboost}
and RandomForest.
