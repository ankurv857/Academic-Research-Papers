\begin{abstract}
Sales promotions are important in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry due to the significant spending on 
promotions and the fact that a large proportion of FMCG products are sold on promotion. This paper considers the 
problem of planning sales promotions for an FMCG product in a grocery retail setting. The category manager has to 
solve the promotion optimization problem (POP) for each product, i.e., how to select a posted price for each period 
in a finite horizon so as to maximize the retailerâ€™s profit. Through our collaboration with Oracle Retail, we 
developed an optimization formulation for the POP that can be used by category managers in a grocery environment. 
Our formulation incorporates business rules that are relevant, in practice. We propose general classes of demand 
functions (including multiplicative and additive), which incorporate the post-promotion dip effect, and can be 
estimated from sales data. In general, the POP formulation has a nonlinear objective and is NP-hard. We then propose 
a linear integer programming (IP) approximation of the POP. We show that the IP has an integral feasible region, 
and hence can be solved efficiently as a linear program (LP). We develop performance guarantees for the profit of 
the LP solution relative to the optimal profit. Using sales data from a grocery retailer, we first show that our 
demand models can be estimated with high accuracy, and then demonstrate that using the LP promotion schedule could 
potentially increase the profit by 3%, with a potential profit increase of 5% if some business constraints were to be relaxed.
