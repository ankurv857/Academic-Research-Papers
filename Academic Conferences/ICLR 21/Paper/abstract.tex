We propose Weighted Parameter Averaging in Deep Neural Network, an algorithm to improve DNN accuracy and 
generalization. Our method is to average the neural network parameters of n best model checkpoints post training, weighted by 
validation loss of respective checkpoints. The resulting model generalizes better than those with a single best checkpoint model
over unseen data. We present the performance of Weighted Parameter Averaging in Deep Neural Network 
at multiple experimental setups. For conducting experiments we use different combinations of Optimizers and Schedulers 
over multiple datasets and present the resulting performance scores. We demonstrate the reduction in error and good 
generalization performance of the resulting models over our experimental datasets.
