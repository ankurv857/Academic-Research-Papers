\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Walmart eco-system goes through very small number of price changes, building a machine learning model on these few 
price changes is a challenging task. The multiproduct approach, regularized regression technique and linear boosting 
technique have been proved to be quite successful to get demand equations as well as elasticity values of products sold 
in Walmart. However, new modelling techniques need to be developed to capture dynamic nature of the products. An approach 
such as Bayesian Structural Time Series could be a good start.
