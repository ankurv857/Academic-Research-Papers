\begin{abstract}
Price Impact Estimator developed by Walmart Labs pricing team provides visibility to the merchants on expected unit 
volume change of an item (UPC) as well as other items (affined/substitute) due to cross-price effects in response 
to a price change. Customer transactions sales has been aggregated at item-store-week and then item-week-national 
level. Forecasting model has been built using regularized regression models to predict the sales units using price,
 seasonality and other features. Elasticity of an item has been estimated using simulation-based approach to quantify 
 the effect of price alone on the unit sales. Accuracy of approximately 84% and coverage of 70% has been achieved using 
 models built at three different levels of merchandise hierarchy.Â
