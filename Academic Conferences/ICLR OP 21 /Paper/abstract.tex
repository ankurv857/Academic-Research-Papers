Personalized marketing has become important for large scale to small scale e-retail firms due to significant raise in
online shopping and market competition. Increase in online shopping and high market competition 
has led to an increase in promotional expenditure for online retailers. Within these firms, the category manager has to 
solve the promotion optimization problem for each consumer segment and item combination, to be able to design the best 
offer for each period in a finite horizon, so as to maximize the retailer's profit. This paper considers the 
problem of planning sales promotions at the intersection of consumer, item and time in e-retail setting, 
where we first predict item purchase propensity and then estimate the consumer offer elasticity 
for solving offer optimization. We build deep neural network model to predict purchase propensity, 
simulation approach for consumer elasticity and finally offer optimization to 
compute best offer at consumer item level.
