In the past few years, various works have been done to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
Some of the past works are [\cite{cohen2018promotion}, \cite{cohen2017impact}, \cite{cohen2020optimizing}], 
which presents study over the impact 
linear optimization promotion planning. 
The paper proposes general classes of demand functions 
(including multiplicative and additive), which incorporate the post-promotion dip effect, and can 
be estimated from sales data. They then propose a linear integer programming to solve Promotion
Optimization problem. We propose a neural network based solution to first predict the 
item purchase probability, then estimate the offer-elasticity of purchase probability at consumer item granularity,
and finally apply dynamic programming approach to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
The optimization framework has been motivated from [\cite{ferreira2016analytics}].
