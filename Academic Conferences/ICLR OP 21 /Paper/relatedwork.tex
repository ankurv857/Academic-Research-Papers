In the past few years, various works have been done to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
Closer to our work is \cite{fader2009probability}, which presents study over the impact 
linear optimizationon promotion planning. The paper proposes general classes of demand functions 
(including multiplicative and additive), which incorporate the post-promotion dip effect, and can 
be estimated from sales data. They then propose a linear integer programming to solve Promotion
Optimization problem. We propose a neural network based solution to first predict the 
item purchase probability, then estimate the offer-elasticity of purchase probability at consumer item granularity,
and finally apply dynamic programming approach to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
