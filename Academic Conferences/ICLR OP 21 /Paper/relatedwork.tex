\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
There has been a significant amount of research conducted on offer-based revenue management over the past few decades.
Multiple great works have been done to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
One such work is \cite{cohen2017impact}, where the
author proposes general classes of demand functions (including multiplicative and additive), which incorporates
post-promotion dip effect, and uses Linear integer programming to solve Promotion Optimization problem.
In one of the other work [\cite{cohen2018promotion}], the author lays out different types of promotions
used in retail, and then formulates the promotion optimization problem for multiple items.
In paper \cite{cohen2018promotion}, the author shows the application of discrete linearization method for solving 
promotion optimization. Gathering learnings from the above papers, we create our framework for offer optimization.
The distinguishing features of our work in this field include 
(i) the use of a nonparametric neural network based approach to estimate the item purchase probability at consumer level,
(ii) the establishment of the functional relationship between historical offer values and purchase probabilities, and
(iii) the creation of a new model and efficient algorithm to set offers by solving a multi-consumer-item promotion
optimization that incorporates offer-elasticity of purchase probability at a reference offer value
