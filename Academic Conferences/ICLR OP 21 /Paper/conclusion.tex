\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented our detailed methodology to solve the offer optimization problem at the intersection 
of consumer, item and time in retail setting. We have also presented the results of our models 
and optimization in the form of model accuracies and graphical representations at a category level.
At the same time we understand that computation strategy is a key aspect in modelling
millions of consumers, and we intend to further explore this aspect by building 
Transfer Learning framework \cite{yosinski2014transferable}. We are also working to 
further improve our Sequence to Sequence neural network architectures to improve accuracy
and decrease computation time.
