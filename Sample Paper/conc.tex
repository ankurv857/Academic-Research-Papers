\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this work we introduced a novel network reconnaissance attack that
exploits the mechanisms and architecture of a Software Defined Network,
giving adversaries an enhanced view of a network compared to 
reconnaissance attacks in traditional networks. We then proposed a 
defense mechanism, \name, which successfully detected our proposed
attack with less than 3\% overhead on both network latency and network
throughput while observing no false positives or false negatives. 
Therefore, we believe \name is an integral piece to a defense in depth
approach to securing SDN and the efforts in this paper motivate future
research exploring new vulnerabilities in the quickly evolving field of
SDN.
